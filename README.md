# 📂 File Organizer Script

This project is a simple Bash script that organizes files in a specified directory based on their file extensions. It also handles hidden files and sorts them accordingly.

## 🛠 Features

- Automatically organizes files by extension (`.txt`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, etc.)
- Moves unknown file types to a `misc` folder
- Detects and organizes **hidden files**
- Creates directories dynamically based on file type

## 📁 File Structure Example

my_folder/ ├── txt/ │ └── notes.txt ├── jpg/ │ └── image.jpg ├── pdf/ │ └── report.pdf └── misc/ └── archive.zip
